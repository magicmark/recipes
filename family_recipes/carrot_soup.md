3. Chopped the shallots
4. Dice the potato

8. Pour over the stock, simmer for another 15 minutes

## Notes

- Don't think mum has ever added chopped parsely (or chervil?)
- Original recipe says "Sometimes boiled rice is served seperately with crecy soup, which makes is pretty substantial. Fried breadcrumbs or small dice or fried potatoes are alternative.
