| Amount | Ingredient                 |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| 0.75lb | carrots                    |
| 1      | large potato               |

| -      | chervil                    |

## Method

1. Peel the carrots, shallots, potatoes
2. Sread them on a coarse grater
3. Chopped the shallots
4. Dice the potato
5. Throw everything into a thick pan with melted butter
6. Season with salt, pepper and a "scrap" of sugar
7. Cover thepan, leave over a very low flame for about 15 minutes until the carrots have almost melted to a puree
8. Pour over the stock, simmer for another 15 minutes
9. Sieve, return the puree to the pan, check seasoning is correct, add a little chopped parsley and some leaves of chervil

## Notes

- Don't think mum has ever added chopped parsely (or chervil?)
- Original recipe says "Sometimes boiled rice is served seperately with crecy soup, which makes is pretty substantial. Fried breadcrumbs or small dice or fried potatoes are alternative.
