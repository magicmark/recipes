# Corn Souffle

Yum!

## Ingredients

Corn Pudding 

- 5 eggs
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/2 cup softened butter
- 2 cans cream style corn
- Salt to taste (I don't add any salt)

## Method

- Preheat oven to 325 degrees 
- Separate yolks from egg whites. Beat whites until stiff. (I do this first so I can use the electric beater without washing it.) 
- Beat yolks with electric mixer and add milk, flour, butter, cream style corn and salt. 
- Fold in egg whites. Pour into greased baking dish (I use 2.8 liter that I think is about 3 quart size). 
- Bake for about 1 hour. 

## Notes

- Originally called "Corn Pudding"
- "I typed it because the recipe I have is over 30 years old and we have revised it a little."
- "It originally called for 1 can of corn but we like it better with 2 cans."
