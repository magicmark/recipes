# Almond Macaroons

Yum!

## Ingredients

- 6 oz Ground Almonds, (or more)
- 8 oz Granulated Sugar
- 2 Egg Whites, (small)
- Split Almonds

## Method

1. Whip egg whites until very stiff
2. Fold in sugar and almonds. Add more almonds if necessary to make a fairly stiff mix, but not quite as stiff as cinnamon balls. (If sticks to hand too much, add more almonds.)
3. Place in small balls on greased tray
4. Place a split almond on top
5. Bake at 160 fan 350F (170C) conventional for 15-20 minutes until pale golden brown

## Notes

- need lots more ground almonds if eggs bigger than small
- Wet hands to make balls. If gets too sticky need a bit more almond in mix
- Add split almond on top for decoration
