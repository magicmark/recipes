# Chicken Garlic Ravioli

This is my attempt at reverse engineering
[Rana's Chicken and Roasted Garlic Raviloi](https://www.giovanniranausa.com/products/chicken-and-roasted-garlic-ravioli.html)

## Ingredients

- 6 eggs
- 280g flour (00, Semolina, AP, whatever. Semolina/00 mix prefered)
- 335 grams tapioca starch
- 2 chicken breasts
- 215g part skim ricotta cheese
- inch wedge of parmesan cheese
- small shake of paprika
- small shake of cayenne
- few big shakes of onion powder
- few big shakes of garlic powder
- big shake of thyme
- small shake of rosemary
- salt to taste
- extra virgin olive oil

## Method

1. [Make pasta dough](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/01/fresh-egg-pasta.html)
2. Cook chicken, let cool
3. Cube chicken, pan fry with olive oil for a few minutes with some of the spice mix
4. Put the cubed chicken and cheese into a blender
5. Blend and combine until it's the consitency of tuna salad. don't blend too much.
6. Put it into the ravioli
7. Cook raviloi for 2 minutes

## Notes

- I used roughly half a 425g tub of lucerne part skim ricotta cheese
- I did 50/50 00 and semolina flour for the raviloi pasta dough
- Spice mix derived from [flavormosaic.com](https://flavormosaic.com/chicken-seasoning-for-roasted-or-rotisserie-chicken/).
- Go very light on the paprika, it's overwhelming.
