# Courgette Soup

Better than it sounds!

Forked from: <https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/quick-and-easy/courgette-and-mint-soup/>

## Ingredients

- olive oil 3 tbsp
- onion 1, finely chopped
- garlic 3 cloves, sliced
- courgettes 6, halved lengthways and sliced thinly
- vegetable stock 750ml
- crème fraîche 150ml, plus a little extra to serve
- mint leaves a small bunch, chopped
- [curry powder](https://shop.mortonbassett.com/curry-powder/p/44121)

## Method

1. Heat the olive oil in a pan over a medium heat and cook the onion with a pinch of salt for 10 minutes until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic and cook gently for a few minutes then tip in the courgettes and cook gently for 20 minutes.
2. Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to the boil for a few minutes. Use a stick blender to whizz the soup until completely smooth, then stir in the crème fraîche and three-quarters of the mint and whizz again. Season.
3. Spoon into bowls and top with more crème fraîche and mint leaves, and some lemon zest, if you like.

## Notes

- I used imagine low sodium vegetable broth (and added salt to taste. Needs more salt than you expect)
