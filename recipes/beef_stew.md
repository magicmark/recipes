# Beef Stew

## Ingredients

- 5 large carrots (?)
- 2 large potatoes
- 1 can fire roasted tomatoes
- bay leaf
- 1/2 bottle red wine
- 1lb of cubed stew beef (?)
- worcestershire sauce
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 cup beef stock (better than bouillon)

## Method

1. Chop carrots into normal carrot sized chunks
2. Peel potatoes, chop into big chunks
3. Peel 2 big garlic cloves
4. Make 1 cup of beef stock (bouillon or otherwise)
5. Add to the pot:
   - carrots (layer the bottom)
   - beef
   - whole garlic cloves
   - beef stock (1 pound?)
   - bay leaf
   - half a bottle of red wine
   - fire roasted tomatoes with chile (normal can size)
   - splash of worcestershire sauce
   - (can wait till near the end) potatoes
6. Keep warm (no more than a slight simmer) for a few hours
7. After beef is nice and tender, mash up the potates into the broth to thicken it

## Notes

- Don't bother adding dried spices near the start, the taste dissipates.
- Wait until near the end to season, so you can taste and control it.
