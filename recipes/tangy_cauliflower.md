### Preparation

**Step 1:**  
Heat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

**Step 2:**  
Make the sweet chermoula: In a large mixing bowl, add the olive oil, honey, garlic, lemon juice, cilantro, paprika, cumin, salt, and a tablespoon of water. Stir together until well combined.

**Step 3:**  
Add the cauliflower florets to the bowl and use your hands or two large spoons to mix them with the chermoula, ensuring each floret is properly coated. Set aside any leftover sweet chermoula for serving.

**Step 4:**  
Place the cauliflower florets on a parchment- or aluminum foil-lined, or nonstick sheet pan. Transfer to the oven and roast for 25 to 35 minutes until the florets are tender and lightly charred.

**Step 5:**  
To serve, spread the yogurt on a large plate and arrange the cauliflower on top. Top with the remaining chermoula. Drizzle everything with olive oil and scatter with cilantro leaves and sliced almonds.
