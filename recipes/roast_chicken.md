# Roast Chicken

Yum!

## Ingredients

- 1 Chicken (back bone removed and flattened)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil (plus extra for the shallots and garlic)
- Salt and pep
- 2 teaspoons Herbes de Provence or chopped fresh herbs
- 6 medium shallots (peeled)
- 8 whole garlic cloves (skins on)

## Method

1. Heat oven to 400°F
2. Spatchcock the chicken: cut out the backbone then flatten it
3. Pat the chicken dry, then rub with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the Herbes de Provence. Place the chicken in a roasting per Toss the shallots and garlic with a little alive oil and scatter them around the chicken.
4. Put the chicken in the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and baste with the juices that have accumulated. Continue roasting the chicken for a another 20-25 minutes; it is done when the juices run clear and a thermometer inserted in the inner thigh reads 155°F.
5. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes. Remove the shallots and garlic, and reserve them. Pour off the juices from the pan, allow them to settle, and reserve. Skim off the fat (it can be refrigerated end used for cooking).
6. Cut the chicken into pieces and place them on a warm platter with the garlic and shallots. Drizzle with the reserved pan juices and serve.

## Notes

- For really crispy skin and superior flavor, buy an air-dried chicken. Take it out of the bag, pat it dry and place on a rack or plate. Season well with salt and allow to sit uncovered in the fridge overnight. Then continue as above.

## Variations

- Use spices instead of the herbs-smoked paprika, cumin or try a blend (your own or a pre-made mix such as Res-el-devout or Chinese five spice).
- Brine the chicken - brining can make a really luscious moist chicken, but you need to plan in advance.
